# Sentiment-Analysis-using-GraphLab--Very-fast

Sentiment Analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive or negative. I created model that predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews) using Graphlab and logistic classifier.
